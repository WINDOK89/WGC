Windows is most certainly the biggest boolshit for this, much easier with linux. But our main programm communicating with G90 team controller connot run under debian

1. FTP

Download and install Filezilla server, no special things to do there just set it up as defualt
run filezilla admin server  GUI
- edit settings
  - passive mode settings
  - check "use custiom port range", put from 1 to 
  - external server IP as default
  uncheck "don't use external IP..."
  - miscalineous
    - check start minimalized
- create than group and user on the D drive where WGC data will be.
- lot of crazy stuff to do now in firewall settings:
  - in windows firewall advanced settings inbound, enable "file and printer sharing (echo request ICMPv4-in)" private and public
  - in windows program feature, turn on "internet info service/FTP server/ftp service" and internet "info service/web management tool/IIS management console"
  - in windows firewall advanced settings inbound, enable also the 3 FTP server stuff
  - still in advanced setting, create a new inbound rule with followning parameter: port, tcp, specified port 20, 21 and finally give a name
  - in windows firewall, allow another programm and browse to filezilla server app.

It should be ok by now

2. auto run of das
- in cmd use: cd ....das...
- in cmd use: das.exe /CfgFile=C:\das_110.cfg
